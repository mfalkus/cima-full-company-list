# CIMA Company Finder

A quick tool to produce a full list of employers who trains their staff with
CIMA. The main site splits them down on different pages, A to Z, which makes
searching awkward.

You can view the list at cima.falkus.co, or run the generate script yourself.

You'll need `perl-Mojolicious`, then just `perl generate` will output for you
to `public/index.html`.
